# PRIME NUMBER🔢

This is a simple Python🐍 application that tells you whether a number is prime or not.

I made this as a program for a problem-solving task I was given: create a code that tells if a number is prime or not. Furthermore, this allowed me to work on my Python coding skills as I am still learning it!
